# Encryption Keys For FreeStyle Libre 2

This repository contains the constants representing the authentication and session
encryption and MAC keys necessary to communicate with a FreeStyle Libre 2 glucometer.

No copyright is claimed for these keys, as they are requisite constants that are part
of the device's communication protocol.

We assert these these keys do not constitute Technical Protection Measures for the
purpose of copyright protection, as they do not protect copyrighted material but
rather obfuscate the communication between two devices under the control of the user.
